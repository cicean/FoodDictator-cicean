# FoodDictator-cicean
Small teams of people who work together often have a tough time figuring out where to go for lunch. If you use consensus, this creates a least-common-denominator solution, very boring.  However, a proclaimed Food Dictator is often more bold and creative in decreeing the lunch spot of the day.    Create a simple app/webapp that can manage a persistent list of people who regularly go out to lunch together to determine food dictators, given the people who are present for lunch on a given day. You can use any logic you want to determine the food dictator.   Integrate an API into your puzzle. Examples might include:  a quote-of-the-day, something relevant to lunch or dictatorship a call out to Facebook or Google to select people from your contacts something that suggests nearby restaurants that have good reviews for lunch
